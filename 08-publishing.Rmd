# Publishing {#sec:publishing}

## Compiling the book {#sec:create-book}

To compile the book, press the 'Build Book' button in R Studio. You may need to press the arrow on the button and select `bookdown::gitbook` the first time you do this.

```{r echo=FALSE, build-book, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Build book button"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/build-book.png")
```

This compiles all the markdown to create html files for the book. The output files should be in the `_book` folder.

## Publishing to Moodle {#sec:moodle-pub}

Publishing to Moodle has now become more straight forward (yay!).

Once you've compiled your book, you should end up with a folder called `_book` (assuming you haven't changed the output folder from the default). To upload to Moodle:

1. Compress your `_book` folder to a zip file. I tend to rename mine at this point so I can keep track of which version is currently on Moodle, e.g. `_book_180124.zip`.

2. Go to where you want to put the link to the book on Moodle and (with editing turned on) select **Add an activity or resource**. 

3. In the pop-up box, select **File**. 

4. Upload your zip file.

5. Once it's uploaded, click on the zip file. In the pop-up box, select **unzip**. 

6. Once it's unzipped, you should see a new folder called `_book`, in addition to your `_book.zip` file. Click on the folder, then on the `index.html` file. 

7. In the "Edit index.html" pop-up box, select **Set main file**. The box should close and you should see that `index.html` is now bold in the file window. 

8. Do any other editing you want for the name and description, then save the changes. Your book will now appear as a link on Moodle!

**TO DO:** Add instructions about how to update individual files. 

## Publishing with github pages {#sec:gh-pages}

I use [github pages](pages.github.com) to publish this guide. My lecture notes now go onto Moodle.  

The following assumes you are already using github to store your files. **TODO: Can add instructions for this part if needed**.

Once you have your book on github, create a new branch called `gh-pages`. This should enable the gh-pages setting in the repo.

Now clone the gh-pages branch into a directory called `book-output`

```
git clone -b gh-pages $repo-path book-output
```
where `$repo-path` is the location of the repository on github, e.g. `https://github.com/your_user_name/lecture_notes.git`

Then you want to copy all the output files into this directory and push it to the gh-pages branch.

```
cd book-output
cp -r ../_book/* ./
git add --all *
git commit -m "Update the book" || true
git push -q origin gh-pages
```

Your pretty lecture notes should now be online! You should find them at github_username.github.io/repo_name - or check the setting page of the repository. The address will be given in the github pages section.
