# Figures {#sec:figures}

Adding figures {#sec:add-figs}
----------------

Figures and captions can be included, but the syntax is quite different to LaTeX.

Assuming that you would add a figure to a LaTeX document with the following code:

```
\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/ho-tension.png}
\caption{This is a figure caption.}
\label{fig:ho-plot}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}
```

To include the figure in markdown the syntax is as follows:


````{verbatim, lang = "r"}
```
{r echo=FALSE, ho-plot, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="This is a figure caption."}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/ho-tension.png")
```
````


```{r echo=FALSE, ho-plot, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="This is a figure caption."}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/ho-tension.png")
```

Important parts of this command:

 * `echo=FALSE` prevents the code being used to display the figure being shown.
 * `ho-plot` is your figure label. 
 * `out-width` is the output width of the figure.
 * `fig.cap` is the figure caption. 
 * `knitr::include_graphics` gives the location of the image file.
 
Figure captions {#sec:fig-captions}
------
Figure captions are controlled by the `fig.cap` setting. Your caption should be inside the double quotes. Remember to use \\" to escape any " characters you may use inside your caption. 

You can include cross-references and citations inside figure captions. See Sections \@ref(sec:fig-nos), \@ref(sec:cross-ref-eqs), and \@ref(sec:tab-syntax) for how to label and cross-reference figures, equations, and tables. Citations are covered in Section \@ref(sec:add-cite).

 
Figure numbering and referencing {#sec:fig-nos}
---------------

 Figures with labels and captions are numbered according to the section (e.g. Fig \@ref(fig:ho-plot) in this case). 
 
 To reference a figure use the syntax
 
 ```markdown
 \@ref(fig:label)
 ```
 where `fig:label` would be `fig:ho-plot` in this case.
 
 You can cross reference between sections/chapters, so make sure to use unique figure labels.
