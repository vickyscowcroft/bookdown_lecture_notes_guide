# Converting from LaTeX notes {#convert-latex}


If you already have LaTeX versions of your notes you can convert these to markdown using pandoc Pandoc won't create *perfect* versions of your notes - you'll most likely have to do a bit of tweaking, but it gets most of the way there. 

You can convert a tex file to Rmd via the command
```
pandoc -f latex -t markdown input-tex.tex -o output-md.Rmd
```
where ```input-tex.tex``` is the name of your tex file and ```output-md.Rmd``` is the name of your output Rmd file.

Batch conversion {#batch-conversion}
----------------

If you want to convert a batch of latex files you can script the process. **TODO** find my batch conversion script.

Tidying up the Rmd file {#tidying}
----------------

Pandoc will have done most of the work in getting your tex file converted to markdown. However, depending on how complex the original file was, you may end up with some tidying to do. 

Things that typically will need fixing are:

 * Section etc labels - if you used underscores in any of your latex labels you should change these to '-' in the markdown file. The underscores confuse markdown. Section \@ref(sec:chapters) discusses sections, chapters, etc.
 * Figures - the syntax for figures is quite different. These will need some tidying up. See Section \@ref(sec:figures) for how to include figures.
 * Equations - the equations themselves should be fine, but if you want to have equation numbers you'll need to do some tidying. See Section \@ref(sec:equations) for the syntax.
 * Tables - tables have a different format but it's pretty easy to convert a latex table using find/replace. See Section \@ref(sec:tables).
 
A note on notes with gaps {#gaps}
---------------
**Think carefully about whether you want to provide notes with gaps**. While they may serve a purpose when the students have a hard-copy of the notes in a live lecture, they will most likely be using your notes on a screen this year.

It is possible to create notes with gaps for things like equations etc for the students to fill in. To do this you need to add some extra code to the `index.Rmd` file:

`````markdown
```
{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit_engines$set(asis = function(options) {
  if (options$echo && options$eval) knit_child(text = options$code)
})
```
`````

Then to "hide" e.g. an equation but still keep the same numbering, edit your equation to the following format:

`````markdown
\begin{equation}
`` `{asis, echo=FALSE}
\Delta s^2 = \Delta x_{1}^{2} + \Delta x_{2}^{2}
`` `
(\#eq:dist01)
\end{equation}
`````

Here the `asis` command and back-ticks wrap around **only** the equation itself, rather than the whole `equation` object. If you wrap the `asis` around the `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` the equation numbering will disappear too. 

**IMPORTANT:** If you're copying and pasting the above code, remove the space between the 2nd and 3rd back-ticks around the `asis` command. **TODO**: Fix this so it displays correctly.
