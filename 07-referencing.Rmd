# Referencing {#sec:referencing}

## Adding citations {#sec:add-cite}

You can reference publications etc using the following syntax:

```markdown
@bibcode 
```
where `bibcode` is the bibcode for the entry in your bib file (see Sec. \@ref(sec:bib-files)). This will give the equivalent of the LaTeX `\citet{}` command.
Example:
```markdown
@2016Scowcroft showed that the SMC is a very elongated galaxy.
```
@2016Scowcroft showed that the SMC is a very elongated galaxy.

For `\citep{}`, just put the citation in square brackets.

```markdown
The first observations of SMC Cepheids were taken over 100 years ago [@1912Leavitt].
```
The first observations of SMC Cepheids were taken over 100 years ago [@1912Leavitt].

## Bibliography files {#sec:bib-files}

Assuming you're using natbib style references you can pass the same bib file to bookdown. 

Example bib file entry:
```markdown
@ARTICLE{1912Leavitt,
       author = {{Leavitt}, Henrietta S. and {Pickering}, Edward C.},
        title = "{Periods of 25 Variable Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud.}",
      journal = {Harvard College Observatory Circular},
         year = "1912",
       volume = {173},
        pages = {1},
}
```

## Reference style {#sec:ref-style}

The referencing style is controlled in the `index.Rmd` file. 

```markdown
bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib]
biblio-style: apalike
link-citations: yes
```
