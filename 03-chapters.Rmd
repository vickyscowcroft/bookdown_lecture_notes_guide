# Chapters, sections, etc {#sec:chapters}

File Structure {#sec:file-structure}
--------

Bookdown organises your notes into a book. The main page you see when you open a bookdown page is the `index.Rmd` file. 

Each chapter in the book has it's own markdown file. Each chapter filename should start with a number, and will be ordered numerically. For this book, the files are

```markdown
index.Rmd
01-intro.Rmd
02-latex-conversion.Rmd
03-chapters.Rmd
... etc
```

Headings {#sec:headings}
--------

The chapter title and label are given in the first line of the file.

```markdown
# Chapters, sections, etc {#sec:chapters}
```

The `#` at the start of the line denotes a chapter heading. The label is given in `{#sec:chapters}`.

You can make sections either using two # at the start of the line, or with dashes under the section title:

```markdown
Headings {#sec:headings}
--------
```
Note that the `{#sec:label}` syntax is still the same - you don't need to say whether it's a chapter, section, subsection etc.

Subsections are done similarly, with either three # at the start of the line.

Cross referencing {#sec:cross-ref}
--------

You can reference other chapters, sections etc throughout the book with the following syntax:

```markdown
Section \@ref(sec:cross-ref) is this section.
```

Which shows up as "Section \@ref(sec:cross-ref) is this section.".

When cross-referencing, you don't need the # before `sec`. That's only used to define the label.
